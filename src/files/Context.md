This is an archive of material belonging to the research project called Plot in Dialogue as part of the MA program at the Centre for Research Architecture. This archive is a mixture of found content, books, articles, recipes, field work drawings and video stills of several ejidos* across Chiapas, Mexico. This project aims to amplify the intimate space of the traspatio* in order to put into dialogue the structures of governance, communal land holding, land cultivation and embodied narratives as they exist in the agrarian context. The archive items are a collection of material whose purpose is to explore the historical conditions of coloniality, political refusal, soil microbes, traditional farming methods, among other living actors -- in order to describe social and biological life as inseparable. This continuous biological-social commoning are the details that work to shelter knowledges. The Plot in Dialogue archive aims to reveal the quiet embodied practices that refuse the coloniality of economic ideologies. The multi-scalar dialogue from soil to the hands of the woman who tend their traspatio's complicate reducibility and instead argues that scenes of everydayness help form political opposition.
